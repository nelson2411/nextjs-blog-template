I decided to write this blog not for the simple reason of writing, but for the purpose of learning Web Development.

As soon as I arrived in Sweden in the spring of 2018, I began receiving advertisements from different sites like freecodecamp, Codecademy, and LinkedIn Learning. Maybe it was something related to the job searching that I was doing at that moment, but then, I started to click on different ads and I explored different platforms for learning to code. I did some research about the job market and I got surprised by all the opportunities and different paths.

It was through an online **[Web Development course at the Universidad of Alicante](https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/activate/course/web-development-I)** in Spain that I learned how to code given by the amazing teacher: Sergio Lujan Mora. Through that course, I explored all the necessary things needed to learn web development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, how the internet works, deployment, optimization, and SEO. Having gone through more than 40 hours of content, I knew what I needed to learn in-depth.

In the beginning, I was motivated by the desire for employability, but later I discovered my passion for learning and coding.

As you explore more and more about coding and the tech field, you'll need to create a LinkedIn profile. Setting and improving my LinkedIn profile led me to discover more resources, and get to know a big and supportive community of developers all around the world.

That took me to two things that I did simultaneously: the Web design responsive path in Freecodecamp and the Become a front-end developer path in the LinkedIn Learning platform.

Let me begin with Freecodecamp. I consider this platform one of the best sources for learning to code, I will give more details about how amazing Freecodecamp is in another post, but for now, let me tell you that here you can find one of the better and more detailed roadmaps for web development. Because of the structure of the curriculum, I found it very motivating. The content covers multiple topics in the field and through this platform, I started to code and build things.
Regarding the roadmap in the "Become a front-end developer" path in LinkedIn Learning, I could acknowledge the difference and tasks between a Front-end developer and a Backend Developer, the technologies involved for every role, and a little bit of the job market for each one. Of course, the learning path helped me to learn about CSS more in deep, Gi t and GitHub, Responsiveness, and UX design principles.

I did all of these while I was working full-time as a dishwasher in two restaurants in Stockholm and gardening as an extra job during summer. I tried to dedicate all the time I could to the learning process.

I almost forget to mention that in the summer of 2019 I started to complete my Bachelor in Business Administration online from a university in El Salvador.

These two years since I came to Sweden, it has been very insightful in terms of professional growth and development. Until this moment I still don't know about ReactJs or Vue or continuous deployment but I felt ready to freelance and build projects.
